<h1>Measurement Setup</h1>
<p> In this part, we automate webpage loading task on android phones (Browser: google chrome) and capture the HAR (HTTP Archive). For HAR auto-generation, we could either use a Man In The Middle(MITM) proxy or simply automate interactivity with android google chrome using chrome dev tools so that web pages are loaded automatically. We chose the latter as it provided a more realistic view of HTTP requests. Additionally, it was convenient.</p>
