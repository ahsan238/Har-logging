<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>As a mobile user, you have a couple of options to enable internet on your device. You can use 2g/3g/4g or you can use Wifi. The network platform that you choose have security implications which manifest when you are browsing the internet. In this research project, we investigate the extent of tracking that occurs when using LTE and Wifi as internet options.The overarching idea is to inspect first and third-party requests that are generated whenever you visit a certain webpage. To add some context, we have bifurcated our data-set into local (Pakistani) and global websites.</p>
